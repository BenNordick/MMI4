## Search for 4-miRNA-site structures in EMT regulation

The `NetworkInstances.ipynb` notebook ([NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) and Pandas required) enumerates instances of the MMI4, Co-targeting-MMI2, and Chained-MMI2 structures in EMT-associated genes. 
This list of EMT genes was adapted from [Tan *et al.* 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4287932/). The transcriptional networks are from [TRRUST version 2](https://www.grnpedia.org/trrust/) ([Han *et al.* 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5753191/)) and [OmniPath](https://omnipathdb.org/) ([TÃ¼rei et al. 2021](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20209923), may have restrictions on commercial use).
